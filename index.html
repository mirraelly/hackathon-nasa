                                unique atmosphere that creates a sky of lilac, blue and green tones. Its environment

                                bioluminescent forests. About 58% of its surface is covered in crystal clear water, and
                                protective magnetic fields are generated by a bismuth core. The inhabitants live

                                        Located about 60 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Lyra, "Draco c" is
                                        in

                                        and cooler than our Earth's Sun. "Draco c" is named after the constellation
                                        Draco,
                                        which
                                        is prominent in the night sky. A year in "Draco c" lasts 200 days of 26 hours
                                        each.

                                        The atmosphere of "Draco c" is predominantly composed of argon (72%), nitrogen

                                        feature is
                                        not
                                        visible to the naked eye, but its presence is fundamental to life and eventually
                                        generates spectacular auroras that can be seen at the ends of the poles.

                                        "Draco c" is not a populated planet, to build the citadels the population uses

                                        technology would allow a more comfortable life, but the inhabitants of "Draco c"
                                        value simplicity and connection with the environment and develop according to
                                        what nature provides, having transport and some floating buildings thanks to

                                The inhabitants of Draco, like humans, have sexual reproduction that involves two
                                individuals, one male and one female, contributing genetic material to create new life.
                                Here is a summary of the process:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><span>Sexual Maturity: </span>Draco individuals reach sexual maturity at a specific
                                    age when
                                    their bodies are ready for reproduction.</li>
                                <li><span>Attraction and Courtship:</span> When a male and female Draco feel attracted
                                    to each other,
                                    they may begin a courtship process. This involves social interactions such as
                                    communication, rituals, or displays of interest.</li>
                                <li><span>Copulation:</span> After successful courtship, the two individuals mate,
                                    similar to human
                                    copulation, where the transfer of male to female genetic material occurs.</li>
                                <li><span>Internal Fertilization:</span> Fertilization can be internal, with the male
                                    genetic
                                    material finding and fertilizing the egg in the female's body.</li>
                                <li><span>Gestation:</span> If fertilization is successful, the female Draco will
                                    develop the embryo
                                    in her body, in a gestation process that can last a specific period of time.</li>
                                <li><span>Birth:</span> After the gestation period, the female will give birth to one or
                                    more
                                    child. The exact way to give birth can vary depending on Draco's specific biology.
                                </li>
                                <li><span>Parental Care:</span> Draco's parents may be responsible for caring for the
                                    puppies,
                                    protecting, feeding and teaching them until they reach independence.</li>

                                colored vegetables, exotic fruits, fish and seafood from the deep ocean. They also value
                                unique herbs and spices to add flavor to their meals. Their diet is rich in nutrients
                                and reflects the abundant biodiversity of their lilac and blue planet.
