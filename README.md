# Nasa International Space Apps Challenge 2023

This site was created during the **NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2023** event, whose theme was *“Exploring Open Science Together”* in collaboration with NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS). Here, we have included various information and curiosities that our study team found relevant for the exploration of the exoplanet **Draco C** (a fictional planet found outside our Solar System, in the orbit of other stars, and inspired by exoplanets that have the possibility of harboring life).

## The Space Apps Challenge 

The Space Apps Challenge was founded in 2012 and has become the world's largest annual global hackathon, with projects recognized as Global Winners and the practice of collaboration, creativity and critical thinking, where teams demonstrate interest in the science and exploration of Earth and the space, helping to raise global awareness of NASA data and encouraging growth and diversity in the next generation of scientists and other professionals.

In 2023, the theme of the event (held on octuber 7th to 8th), was ***“Exploring Open Science Together”*** in collaboration with NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS).

## About The Challenge 

Are we alone in the universe? To address this question, NASA’s next flagship space telescope, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will search for habitable planets beyond our solar system. What do you think these worlds will look like? Your challenge is to use publicly available information on habitable worlds to design your own habitable world and write about what life might be like on it.

## The Draco Team

The **Draco Team** is a tenacious and courageous team, ready to face challenges with determination. Just as the Draco constellation represents a dragon in mythology, this team symbolizes the will to conquer obstacles and achieve goals, even in the face of difficulties. A united and resilient team, ready to overcome any adversity it encounters on its missions.
